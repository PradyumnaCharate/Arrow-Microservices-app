For testing we are going to use jest and sepeset to call apis.
Testing goals:
1)Test single code(ex.just middleware)
2)Test code pieces together(ex.middleware and route)
3)test components together(if api and databases are working together correctly)
4)testing services together(if receiving events and emitting events correctly)

SO superset requires express app so we have refactored index.js code into app.js and index.js.app.js just configures express app.
Also we will installing in memory mongodb so we can test multiple dataabases correctly.
